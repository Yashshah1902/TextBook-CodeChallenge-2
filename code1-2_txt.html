<h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>

<p>We make ourselves a place apart<br>
     Behind light words that tease and flout,<br>
But oh, the agitated heart<br>
     Till someone find us really out.</p>

<p>'Tis pity if the case require<br>
     (Or so we say) that in the end<br>
We speak the literal to inspire<br>
     The understanding of a friend.</p>

<p>But so with all, from babes that play<br>
     At hide-and-seek to God afar,<br>
So all who hide too well away<br>
     Must speak and tell us there they are.</p>
