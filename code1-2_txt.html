<h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>

<p>We make ourselves a place apart
     Behind light words that tease and flout,
But oh, the agitated heart
     Till someone find us really out.</p>

<p>'Tis pity if the case require
     (Or so we say) that in the end
We speak the literal to inspire
     The understanding of a friend.</p>

<p>But so with all, from babes that play
     At hide-and-seek to God afar,
So all who hide too well away
     Must speak and tell us there they are.</p>
